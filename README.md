# Music Player E-Learning Challenge

This project was created in 2022 as part of a challenge for instructional designers to implement a music player into their e-learning courses. The idea came after Verizon launched a course featuring a music player, and it inspired me to encourage others to experiment with the concept.

## Project Overview

The project is a simple single-slide prototype that uses a dial to select between different music tracks. Each selection triggers the appropriate track to play while pausing any other tracks that may have been playing.

This basic setup could easily be applied to a master slide to enable music playback across an entire course. It would allow the music to continue as the learner navigates through multiple slides.
